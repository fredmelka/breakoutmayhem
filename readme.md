## About the project


 This repository is the first coding project built entirely from the ground-up in the course of my Web Development formation.
 Its purpose is to practice and rehearse concepts and languages.
 Given requirement was to develop a game app and I set myself the additional goal to create a real-time (not turn-by-turn) two players game.

## Breakout Mayhem

The game is a tribute to two masterpiece classics of computing games: the ✨Pong✨ and ✨Breakout✨.
Two players battle with a paddle to control their balls and destroy as much bricks as possible and earn points.

## Settings and futures releases

Most settings can be modified through a singleton object, including: game speed, ball controls, number of lives, ball strength, brick sizes, etc.
Players can create and edit their own gamemaps via a .xls file attached: layout, bricks, walls, brick sizes, etc.
Coming updates of the project will likely include animations, candies released, single player mode, and more surprises!

## Tools used in the project

- Languages: Javascript, HTML and CSS.
- Concepts: DOM manipulation, functions & callbacks, arrays & iterators, objects, asynchronous programming, classes, modules, responsive design, external libraries.
