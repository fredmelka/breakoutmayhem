### _Breakout Mayhem_ ![game logo](./img/breakoutmayhem.png)

The repository is the first coding project built entirely from the ground-up in the course of the software engineering formation. The purpose is to rehearse computer science concepts and programming languages. Project specification was to develop a game application.

I did set myself with the additional objective to develop a real-time two players game (as opposed to just turn-by-turn).

**About**

_Breakout Mayhem_ is a tribute to two masterpiece classics of computing games ✨**Pong**✨ and ✨**Breakout**✨. Two players compete with a paddle to control their ball and destroy as much bricks as possible and earn points. Bricks can contain surprises and super powers!

**Controllers**

| Action | Desktop | Mobile |
|:--------|:-----------:|:------------:|
| Move **left** paddle | $Q$ and $W$ | _touch_ event |
| Move **right** paddle | $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ | _touch_ event | 
| Quit game | hold _spacebar_ | triple click one score card |

**Settings**

Most parameters of the game may be changed through a _singleton_ object including ball speed, paddle control, number of lives, brick sizes, etc. Players can also easily build their own map via one Excel spreadsheet attached in the repository: layout, bricks, walls.

**Languages and concepts**

- Javascript (ES6), HTML5, CSS3 ;
- DOM manipulation, functions, callbacks, iterators, objects, classes, modules, asynchronous programming, responsive design, external libraries ;
- OOP and functional programming.
