# _Breakout Mayhem_


## About the project


 The repository is the first coding project built entirely from the ground-up in the course of my web development formation.

 Its purpose is to rehearse coding concepts and programming languages.

 Project specification was to develop a game application.
 
 I set myself with the additional objective to build a real-time (not just turn-by-turn) two players game.


## Breakout Mayhem

The game is a tribute to two masterpiece classics of computing games ✨Pong✨ & ✨Breakout✨.

Two players battle with a paddle to control their balls and destroy as much bricks as possible and earn points.

Bricks can contain surprises and super powers!

## How to play the game

Desktop controllers:
1. 'Q' and 'W' keys to control left paddle
2. 'Arrow Up' and 'Arrow Down' keys control right paddle.

Mobile controllers:

- Just use your fingers to swipe the paddles!


## Settings

Most game settings can be modified through a singleton object, e.g. ball speed, paddle control, number of lives, brick sizes..

Developers can also create easily their own map via a .xls file attached in the github repository: layout, bricks, walls..


## Tools used for this project

- Languages: Javascript (ES6), HTML5, CSS3.

- Concepts: DOM manipulation, functions & callbacks, arrays & iterators, objects, asynchronous programming, classes, modules, responsive design, external libraries.

Many of the code follows 'React framework' approach with functional components.


Thanks for your attention and Happy Gaming !
