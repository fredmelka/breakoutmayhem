# _Crazy Breakout Mayhem Game_


## About the project


 This repository is the first coding project built entirely from the ground-up in the course of my Web Development formation.

 Its purpose is to practice and rehearse coding concepts and programming languages.

 Project specification was to develop a game app.
 
 I set myself the additional objective to build a real-time (not turn-by-turn) two players game.


## Breakout Mayhem

The game is a tribute to two masterpiece classics of computing games: ✨Pong✨ and ✨Breakout✨.

Two players battle with a paddle to control their balls and destroy as much bricks as possible and earn points.

## How to play the game

Desktop controllers:
1. 'Q' and 'W' keys to control left paddle
2. 'Arrow Up' and 'Arrow Down' keys control right paddle.

Mobile controllers:

- Swipe paddles with your fingers!


## Settings and futures releases

Most game settings can be modified through a singleton object: game speed, ball controls, number of lives, ball strength, brick sizes, etc.

Developers can also create their own gamemaps via a '.xls' file attached to the github repository: layout, bricks, walls, brick sizes, etc.

Coming updates of the project will include sounds, animations, candies and more surprises!


## Tools used in the project

- Languages: Javascript, HTML and CSS.

- Concepts: DOM manipulation, functions & callbacks, arrays & iterators, objects, asynchronous programming, classes, modules, responsive design, external libraries.


Thanks for your attention and Happy Gaming !
